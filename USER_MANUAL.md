## Getting Started - Logging In

### How to Log In

NEXUS uses Google to sign you in. This means you don't need to remember a separate password - you just use your Google account.

**Important:** You can only log in if your email address ends with **@seecs.edu.pk**. This is a security feature to make sure only authorized users can access the system.

### Step-by-Step Login Process

1. **Open the NEXUS website** in your web browser.

2. **Click the "Continue with Google" button** on the login page. You'll see a button with the Google logo on it.

3. **Google will ask you to sign in** (if you're not already signed in to Google). Enter your Google account email and password. Remember, it must be your @seecs.edu.pk email address.

4. **Google will ask for permission** to share your information with NEXUS. Click "Allow" or "Continue" to proceed.

5. **You'll be automatically redirected** back to NEXUS, and you'll be logged in!

### What Happens After Login?

Once you're logged in, you'll see your homepage. This shows all the workspaces you're part of. If this is your first time, you might not see any workspaces yet - that's okay! You can create one or wait for someone to invite you.

### Troubleshooting Login Issues

**Problem:** "You can't sign in with this email"
- **Solution:** Make sure you're using an email that ends with @seecs.edu.pk. If you're using a different Google account, you'll need to switch to your SEECS email.

**Problem:** The page keeps loading or nothing happens
- **Solution:** Check your internet connection. If it's still not working, try refreshing the page or clearing your browser's cache.

**Problem:** You see an error message
- **Solution:** Make sure you clicked "Allow" when Google asked for permission. If the problem continues, try logging out of Google completely and then trying again.

## Understanding Workspaces

### What is a Workspace?

Think of a workspace like a virtual office or a project room. It's a place where you and your teammates can work together, share messages, and organize your conversations.

### Creating Your First Workspace

1. **Go to your homepage** (you'll see this right after logging in).

2. **Click the "Create Workspace" button** (usually at the top of the page or in a prominent location).

3. **Fill in the workspace details:**
   - **Name:** Give your workspace a name, like "Project Team" or "Study Group"
   - **Type:** Choose if this workspace is:
     - **Private:** Only people you invite can see and join
     - **Public:** Anyone in your organization can find and join it

4. **Add team members (optional):** You can type in email addresses of people you want to invite. They must already have NEXUS accounts with @seecs.edu.pk emails.

5. **Click "Create"** and you're done!

### What Happens When You Create a Workspace?

When you create a workspace, NEXUS automatically creates a channel called "#general" for you. This is where everyone in the workspace can chat. You can think of channels as different conversation rooms within your workspace.

### Joining an Existing Workspace

If someone invites you to a workspace, you'll see it appear on your homepage automatically. Just click on it to open it and start chatting!

### Understanding Channels

Channels are like different conversation topics within a workspace. For example:
- **#general** - For general discussions everyone should see
- **#announcements** - For important updates
- **#random** - For casual conversations
- **#project-updates** - For specific project discussions

**Public Channels:** Anyone in the workspace can see and join these channels. When you send your first message in a public channel, you're automatically added to it.

**Private Channels:** Only people who are specifically added can see and join these channels. You won't even see private channels you're not part of.

### Creating a New Channel

1. **Open your workspace** by clicking on it from your homepage.

2. **Look for a button or link** that says "Add Channel" or has a "+" icon next to the channel list.

3. **Fill in the channel details:**
   - **Name:** What you want to call this channel (like "design-discussions")
   - **Description:** What this channel is for (optional but helpful)
   - **Privacy:** Choose if it should be public or private

4. **Click "Create"** and your new channel is ready!

## Chatting and Messaging

### How to Send a Message

1. **Select a channel** from the list on the left side of your screen. Click on the channel name (like "#general").

2. **Type your message** in the text box at the bottom of the screen. This is where you'll see "Type a message..." or similar text.

3. **Press Enter** or click the "Send" button (usually an arrow or paper plane icon).

4. **Your message appears** in the conversation! Everyone in that channel can see it.

### Reading Messages

Messages appear in the main area of your screen, with the newest messages at the bottom. You'll see:
- **The person's name** who sent the message
- **The time** they sent it
- **The message content**

The page automatically scrolls to show you the newest messages, so you don't have to scroll down manually.

### Replying to Messages (Threads)

Sometimes you want to reply to a specific message instead of just adding to the conversation. This is called "threading."

1. **Hover over a message** you want to reply to.

2. **Click the "Reply" button** (usually appears when you hover over the message).

3. **Type your reply** in the text box that appears.

4. **Send your reply** and it will be connected to the original message, making it easier to follow conversations.

### Editing Your Messages

Made a typo? No problem!

1. **Hover over your own message** (you can only edit messages you sent).

2. **Click the "Edit" button** (usually appears as a pencil icon).

3. **Make your changes** in the text box.

4. **Save your changes** and the message will be updated.

### Real-Time Updates

One of the best things about NEXUS is that you see new messages instantly! When someone sends a message in a channel you're viewing, it appears on your screen right away - no need to refresh the page.

### Message Features

- **Emoji Reactions:** You can add emoji reactions to messages by clicking on them. This is a quick way to show you liked something or agree with it.
- **File Attachments:** You can attach files to your messages (if this feature is enabled in your workspace).
- **Mentions:** You can mention other users by typing "@" followed by their name to get their attention.

## AI Search - Finding What You Need

### What is AI Search?

AI Search helps you find messages, channels, and workspaces quickly. Instead of scrolling through hundreds of messages, you can just type what you're looking for and find it instantly.

### How to Use AI Search

1. **Click on "AI Search"** in the navigation menu (usually at the top of the page or in a sidebar). You might see a search icon or a button labeled "Search."

2. **Type what you're looking for** in the search box. For example:
   - "project update"
   - "meeting notes"
   - "deadline"
   - A person's name
   - A channel name

3. **Press Enter** or wait a moment, and results will appear below.

### Understanding Search Results

The search results are organized into different types:

**Messages:**
- Shows you actual messages that contain your search term
- Displays who sent it, which channel it's in, and when it was sent
- Click on a message result to go directly to that conversation

**Channels:**
- Shows channels whose names or descriptions match your search
- Only shows channels you have access to
- Click on a channel to open it

**Workspaces:**
- Shows workspaces whose names match your search
- Only shows workspaces you're a member of
- Click on a workspace to open it

### Tips for Better Searches

- **Be specific:** Instead of searching for "meeting," try "team meeting December" to get more relevant results
- **Use keywords:** Think about the main words in what you're looking for
- **Try different terms:** If you don't find what you need, try searching with different words
- **Check the channel:** Results show which channel the message is in, which can help you find related conversations

### What Gets Searched?

AI Search looks through:
- All messages in workspaces you're part of
- All channel names and descriptions you have access to
- All workspace names you're a member of

**Important:** You can only see results from workspaces and channels you have access to. Private channels you're not part of won't appear in your search results, which helps keep your information secure.

## Video Calls - Talking Face to Face

### Starting a Video Call

Sometimes typing messages isn't enough - you need to talk face to face! NEXUS has built-in video calling so you can have meetings right in the app.

1. **Open a workspace** where you want to have the call.

2. **Look for the video call icon** (usually a phone or camera icon) in the top right corner of the chat area.

3. **Click the video call icon.**

4. **Allow camera and microphone access** when your browser asks. This is necessary for video calls to work. Click "Allow" when prompted.

5. **You're now in the call!** Your video will appear on the screen, and you'll see yourself in the call.

### Joining an Active Call

If someone else in your workspace has already started a call, you'll see a notification or the call icon will show "Join active call."

1. **Click the call icon** or the "Join call" button.

2. **Allow camera and microphone access** when prompted.

3. **You'll join the call** and see everyone else who's already there!

### During a Video Call

Once you're in a call, you'll see several controls at the bottom of your screen:

**Microphone Button (🎤):**
- Click to mute or unmute your microphone
- When muted, others can't hear you (useful if there's background noise)
- The button will show a line through it when you're muted

**Camera Button (📹):**
- Click to turn your camera on or off
- When off, others can't see you, but you can still see and hear them
- Useful if you need privacy or if your internet is slow

**Screen Share Button (🖥️):**
- Click to share your screen with everyone in the call
- You can choose to share your entire screen or just a specific window
- Great for presentations or showing something on your computer
- Click the button again to stop sharing

**End Call Button (📞):**
- The red button to leave the call
- Click this when you're done with the call
- The call continues for others until everyone leaves

### Seeing Other People

When others join the call, you'll see their video appear on your screen. The layout automatically adjusts based on how many people are in the call:
- **2 people:** You'll see each other side by side
- **3+ people:** Videos arrange in a grid so everyone is visible

### Best Practices for Video Calls

- **Check your internet connection:** Video calls need a stable internet connection. If your connection is slow, consider turning off your camera to improve audio quality.
- **Find a quiet place:** Background noise can be distracting. Use the mute button when you're not speaking.
- **Look at the camera:** Try to position yourself so others can see you clearly, and look at your camera (not the screen) when speaking to make better eye contact.
- **Use screen share wisely:** Only share your screen when you need to show something. It uses more internet bandwidth.
- **Be patient:** Sometimes it takes a moment for video and audio to connect. Give it a few seconds.

### Troubleshooting Video Calls

**Problem:** "Can't access camera/microphone"
- **Solution:** Click the lock icon in your browser's address bar and make sure camera and microphone permissions are set to "Allow." You may need to refresh the page after changing permissions.

**Problem:** Can't see or hear other people
- **Solution:** Make sure they've allowed camera and microphone access too. Also check that your internet connection is stable.

**Problem:** Video is choppy or keeps freezing
- **Solution:** Try turning off your camera (you can still hear and be heard). This reduces the amount of data being sent and can improve the call quality.

**Problem:** Can't hear audio
- **Solution:** Check your computer's volume settings and make sure your speakers or headphones are working. Also check that the other person's microphone isn't muted.

**Problem:** Screen share isn't working
- **Solution:** Make sure you're using a desktop or laptop computer (screen sharing doesn't work on mobile devices). Also, make sure you select the correct window or screen when prompted.

## Tips and Tricks

### Staying Organized

- **Use channel names wisely:** Create channels with clear, descriptive names so everyone knows what they're for
- **Keep #general for important announcements:** Don't clutter #general with casual chat - use #random or create a casual channel for that
- **Use threads for focused discussions:** When a conversation gets long, start using threads to keep things organized

### Communication Best Practices

- **Be clear and concise:** Write messages that are easy to understand
- **Use emoji reactions:** Instead of sending "👍" as a separate message, use the reaction feature
- **Check before creating new channels:** Make sure a channel doesn't already exist for your topic
- **Reply in threads:** Keep conversations organized by replying in threads rather than starting new message chains

### Making the Most of Search

- **Search regularly:** Don't scroll through old messages - use search instead
- **Use specific terms:** The more specific your search, the better results you'll get
- **Check the date:** Search results show when messages were sent, so you can find recent or old information

### Video Call Tips

- **Test your setup first:** Before an important call, test your camera and microphone
- **Close unnecessary apps:** This helps your computer run the video call smoothly
- **Use headphones:** This reduces echo and makes it easier to hear others
- **Have a backup plan:** If video isn't working, you can still participate with audio only

### Getting Help

If you're having trouble with something:
1. **Check this manual first** - it covers most common questions
2. **Ask in #general** - your teammates might know the answer
3. **Try refreshing the page** - sometimes a simple refresh fixes issues
4. **Check your internet connection** - many features need a stable connection
